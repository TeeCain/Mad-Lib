# Mad-Lib

A Mad Libs game is a fun and interactive way of building a story. It lets the user input various parts of speech to fill in blanks of a pre-written story. The objective is to fill in the blanks with random parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives to get a quirky story as a result.

The user will enter either a noun, verb or adjective based on the prompts given. Once all the input fields have been filled, the entire story is displayed to the user. The program will then automatically end.
